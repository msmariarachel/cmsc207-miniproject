<h1>CMSC 207 Mini-Project: Personal Web Profile</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This is a simple personal web profile created as part of my CMSC 207 Web Programming and Development course. The project showcases fundamental web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2>Features</h2>

**Basic HTML Structure**: A structured webpage with a header, navigation menu, main content, and footer.

**CSS Styling**: Aesthetic improvements, basic animations and transitions using an external CSS file.

**Interactivity with JavaScript**: Clicking the "**Fun Fact About Me**" button displays a random fact.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

The webpage loads with a structured layout containing my personal information.

A "Fun Fact About Me" button is included. When clicked, JavaScript displays a fun fact.
